# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the single-page site more visually attractive by placing the 12 uploaded photos across key sections and update branding assets (favicon + logo) derived from the shop signboard image.

**Planned changes:**
- Add all 12 uploaded images as optimized static frontend assets and place them across the page (hero + relevant service sections) using responsive layouts (grid/cards) with appropriate cropping for mobile/desktop.
- Update the hero section to feature a prominent uploaded tractor/music visual while preserving text readability (e.g., overlay/gradient).
- Replace the favicon with an enhanced square icon derived from the Beniwal Music Center / Beniwal Music Stereo signboard image, and update header/footer logo to match (crisp rendering; transparent background if applicable).
- Add English alt text for all placed images.
- Add an on-page English note in the Contact section asking the owner to provide phone number, address, and business hours (placeholders remain).

**User-visible outcome:** The site displays the uploaded photos throughout the hero and service sections in a clean, responsive layout, shows the updated favicon/branding in the browser tab and header/footer, and includes a clear prompt in the Contact section to provide real contact details later.
