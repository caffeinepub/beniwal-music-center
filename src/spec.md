# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish the existing Beniwal Music Center website as a permanent Internet Computer deployment with a stable, shareable icp0.io link.

**Planned changes:**
- Deploy the current app to a production (non-draft, non-expiring) Internet Computer canister so the icp0.io URL remains stable.
- Verify the published canister serves the latest frontend build and static assets (e.g., favicon and images) without errors.
- Provide the final permanent icp0.io link for the user to share.

**User-visible outcome:** The user receives a single permanent icp0.io website link that loads reliably for anyone and does not later show “invalid canister” / “Canister ID Not Resolved”.
