# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a responsive one-page marketing website for “Beniwal Music Center” that clearly presents the shop’s tractor music systems, modification materials, electrical mechanic services, and contact placeholders.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a responsive landing/home section with the prominent title “Beniwal Music Center” and a short English introduction to the shop.
- Add dedicated on-page sections: “Tractor Music Systems”, “Tractor Modification Materials” (mentioning reasonable prices), and “Electrical Mechanic Services” (stating an electrical mechanic is available).
- Add a “Contact” section with clearly marked placeholders for Phone, Address, and Hours (to be added later).
- Add simple navigation links to jump/scroll to: Home, Tractor Music Systems, Tractor Modification Materials, Electrical Mechanic Services, Contact.
- Apply a cohesive, bold, practical visual theme suitable for a tractor/automotive shop, avoiding a blue/purple-dominant palette.
- Include generated static image assets (logo and hero banner) stored under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and referenced in the header/hero/landing area.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can view a clean, mobile-friendly site for Beniwal Music Center, navigate to each service section, see a logo and hero banner, and find a contact section with clearly marked “coming soon/to be added” contact details.
