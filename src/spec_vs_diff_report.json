  "summary": "Diff adds a SafeImage component and updates App.tsx to use a new generated brand icon path. It also claims index.html favicon updates and broader styling/theme changes, but the diff summary does not provide evidence that the new icon files were actually added, that all broken images were fixed end-to-end, or that the redeploy/canister-resolution issue was addressed.",

      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Generate new brand icon assets from download-2.webp and reference them consistently (favicon + apple-touch-icon in frontend/index.html under /assets/generated/; header/footer logo in App.tsx uses generated square icon).",
      "reason": "App.tsx references /assets/generated/bmc-icon.dim_512x512.png, but the diff summary does not show the actual generated image assets being added under frontend/public/assets/generated/, and the App.tsx snippet only shows the header logo (no evidence for footer logo update). index.html changes are only described in a secondary summary file, not shown as direct diff evidence.",

      "reason": "SafeImage provides graceful degradation, but the diff summary does not show concrete updates to the hero background and service-section gallery image paths or confirmation that all referenced assets exist and are URL-safe. App.tsx where those images live is truncated and the actual image path changes are not evidenced.",
