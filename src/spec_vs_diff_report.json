  "summary": "The diff adds a frontend helper to construct/copy an icp0.io share link from an environment variable and introduces deployment documentation, but it does not (and cannot, from the shown changes) actually perform or guarantee a permanent non-draft Internet Computer deployment or provide the final stable icp0.io URL. Several additional frontend content/design/asset changes appear unrelated to the requested deployment/link-only scope and may conflict with the stated non-goals about not changing marketing content.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Deploy the existing Beniwal Music Center app as a permanent (non-draft, non-expiring) Internet Computer canister so the public icp0.io URL remains stable and does not later show “invalid canister” / “Canister ID Not Resolved”.",
      "reason": "The changes shown are limited to frontend code and documentation; there is no evidence of configuration or deployment artifacts (e.g., dfx canister IDs, network settings, CI/deploy scripts) that actually create a production (non-draft) deployment or ensure the canister remains permanently resolvable.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Provide the final permanent, shareable website link (icp0.io URL) that the user can send to others.",
      "reason": "No concrete canister ID or final icp0.io URL is included; the implementation only constructs a URL at runtime from `import.meta.env.VITE_CANISTER_ID`, which is not the same as providing the final verified link.",
