  "summary": "Diff updates the SPA’s React app and HTML head to reference new static image/icon assets and adds a Contact-section prompt (per file summary). However, no new image files were added in the diff, so the requested 12 optimized images and generated favicon/icon assets cannot be confirmed as actually included in the build output.",

      "requirement": "Add the 12 uploaded images as optimized static assets and place them throughout the existing single-page site (hero + service sections) with responsive/cropped layouts and alt text.",
      "reason": "The code references generated assets and the summary mentions galleries, but the diff shows zero added files, and there is no evidence the 12 optimized images were actually added under static assets (e.g., frontend/public/assets/generated). Without asset additions, the acceptance criterion that all 12 images are included as static assets cannot be verified.",
