  "summary": "Diff adds a single-page React app with sticky header navigation, warm industrial theme tokens, and references a generated logo image. However, the required generated image assets are not present in the diff, and several required section labels/placeholders cannot be confirmed (and nav labels appear to not match the required wording). The diff also introduces Internet Identity/auth and actor hooks that were not requested for a marketing site.",
